I want to predict GM volume in a group of patients based on their degree of cognitive impairment, corrected for age and sex. To have a more ¡®disease specific¡¯ measure of cognition, I use cognitive performance-scores in a large group (N=500) of healthy controls (HC) as a reference.

Me and my supervisor discussed two methods for doing this (the w-score vs. the z-score method):

1. w-score method:

a. calculate the effect of age and sex on cognitive score in the HC group (cognition = a + (b * age) + (c * sex))

b. predict cognitive score in the patient group based on the regression coefficients we found in the HC group

c. for each patient, subtract this predicted score from his actual score, and divide by the SD of the HC¡¯s residuals (w-score = (cognition.obs ? cognition.pred)/SDres)

d. perform a regression in which w-score predicts GM volume (GM volume = a + (b * w-score))

2. z-score method:

a. calculate the mean and SD of cognitive score in the HC group

b. for each patient, subtract the HC¡¯s mean from his actual cognitive score, and divide by the HC¡¯s SD (z-score = (cognition.obs ? cognition.mean)/SD)

c. perform a regression in which z-score predicts GM volume, using age and sex as covariates (GM volume = a + (b * z-score) + (c * age) + (d * sex))
